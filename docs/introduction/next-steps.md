# Next steps

The [Recipes 🍱](../recipes) section is made up of small tutorials. Each one details how to perform mundane tasks, such as measuring the performance of a model, selecting hyperparameters, etc.

The [Examples 🌶️](../examples) section contains more involved notebooks which carry less explanations. Each notebook addresses a particular machine learning problem.

The [API 📚](../api) section references all the modules, classes, and functions in River. It is automatically generated from the codebase's Python docstrings.

Feel welcome to open a discussion if you have questions. Before that you can check out the [FAQ 🙋](../faq) section, which has answers to recurring questions.

The different released versions are listed in the [Releases 🏗](../releases) section. Changes that will be part of the next release are listed in the unreleased section of the documentation's development version, which you may find here.

We recommend checking out [Awesome Online Machine Learning]([https://git](https://github.com/online-ml/awesome-online-machine-learning)) if you want to go deeper. There you will find online machine learning related content: research papers, alternative and complementary software, blog posts, etc.
